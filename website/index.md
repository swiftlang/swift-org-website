## Community Participation

Everyone is welcome to contribute to the Swift.org website in the following ways:

Such proposals require consultation with the [website workgroup](/website-workgroup) and can be proposed as a public forum post on [Swift.org website forum](https://forums.swift.org/c/swift-website/) or privately by contacting [@swift-website-workgroup](https://forums.swift.org/new-message?groupname=swift-website-workgroup) on the Swift Forums. Example for such broad changes include:
    * Proposing new topics and content domains, or broad changes to existing ones.
    * Proposing broad changes to how content is organized in the website (information design).
    * Proposing broad changes to how the website looks (UX/UI design).
    * Proposing broad changes to the technical infrastructure that powers the website.
* Participating in design discussions.
* Asking or answering questions on the forums.
* Reporting or triaging bugs.

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-org-website/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for additional information about the website's contribution guidelines.


## Governance

The website has a small list of *maintainers* which have *write* access and are in charge of reviewing and merging pull requests from *contributors*.
The *maintainers* group consists of a small subset of the Swift core team and the [Swift website workgroup members](/website-workgroup).

The Swift.org website source code consists of several distinct parts:

1. General content: Markdown, HTML, data files, images and other content.
2. Blog posts: Source files for blog posts, mostly in markdown form.
3. Technical infrastructure: Code and scripts for generating the website’s final static content (HTML mostly) from other forms of textual content such as Markdown and HTML files.
4. Information design, user experience and user interface design: The layout and navigation of the website, including CSS and images used to define the user experience and user interface.

Each one of these areas is governed by a slightly different contribution process that matches their nature.

See [Swift.org governance](/website-governance) for additional information about the website's governance.


## Website workgroup

The Swift website workgroup is a steering team that helps guide the evolution on the Swift.org website. The Swift website workgroup will:

* Define a set of processes that govern the contributions to the Swift.org website.
* Actively guide Swift.org website development and contributions.
* Define and prioritize Swift.org website related efforts that address the needs of the Swift community.
* Channel feedback to Swift core team about the needs of the Swift community.
