See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-org-website/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for additional information about the website's contribution guidelines.


## Governance

The website has a small list of *maintainers* which have *write* access and are in charge of reviewing and merging pull requests from *contributors*.
The *maintainers* group consists of a small subset of the Swift core team and the [Swift website workgroup members](/website-workgroup).

The Swift.org website source code consists of several distinct parts:

1. General content: Markdown, HTML, data files, images and other content.
2. Blog posts: Source files for blog posts, mostly in markdown form.
3. Technical infrastructure: Code and scripts for generating the websiteâ€™s final static content (HTML mostly) from other forms of textual content such as Markdown and HTML files.
4. Information design, user experience and user interface design: The layout and navigation of the website, including CSS and images used to define the user experience and user interface.

Each one of these areas is governed by a slightly different contribution process that matches their nature.

See [Swift.org governance](/website-governance) for additional information about the website's governance.


## Website workgroup

The Swift website workgroup is a steering team that helps guide the evolution on the Swift.org website. The Swift website workgroup will:

* Define a set of processes that govern the contributions to the Swift.org website.
* Actively guide Swift.org website development and contributions.
* Define and prioritize Swift.org website related efforts that address the needs of the Swift community.
* Channel feedback to Swift core team about the needs of the Swift community.
