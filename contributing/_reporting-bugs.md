## Reporting Bugs

Reporting bugs is a great way for anyone to help improve Swift. The open source Swift project uses GitHub Issues for tracking bugs.

<div class="info" markdown="1">
If a bug can be reproduced only within an Xcode project or a playground,
or if the bug is associated with an Apple NDA,
please file a report to Apple's [bug reporter][apple-bugtracker] instead.
</div>

When opening an issue, please include the following:

- **A concise description of the problem.**
  If the issue is a crash, include a stack trace. Otherwise, describe the behavior you were expecting to see, along with the behavior you actually observed.

- **A reproducible test case.**
  Double-check that your test case reproduces the issue. A relatively small sample (roughly within 50 lines of code) is best pasted directly into the description; a larger one may be uploaded as an attachment. Consider reducing the sample to the smallest amount of code possible—a smaller test case is easier to reason about and more appealing to сontributors.

- **A description of the environment that reproduces the problem.**
  Include information about the Swift compiler's version, the deployment target (if explicitly set) and your platform.

Because Swift is under very active development, we receive a lot of bug reports. Before opening a new issue, take a moment to browse our [existing issues](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/issues) to reduce the chance of reporting a duplicate.
