## Reporting Bugs

Reporting bugs is a great way for anyone to help improve Swift. The open source Swift project uses GitHub Issues for tracking bugs.

<div class="info" markdown="1">
If a bug can be reproduced only within an Xcode project or a playground,
or if the bug is associated with an Apple NDA,
please file a report to Apple's [bug reporter][apple-bugtracker] instead.
</div>

When opening an issue, please include the following:

- **A concise description of the problem.**
  If the issue is a crash, include a stack trace. Otherwise, describe the behavior you were expecting to see, along with the behavior you actually observed.

- **A reproducible test case.**
  Double-check that your test case reproduces the issue. A relatively small sample (roughly within 50 lines of code) is best pasted directly into the description; a larger one may be uploaded as an attachment. Consider reducing the sample to the smallest amount of code possible — a smaller test case is easier to reason about and more appealing to сontributors.

- **A description of the environment that reproduces the problem.**
  Include information about the Swift compiler's version, the deployment target (if explicitly set) and your platform.

Because Swift is under very active development, we receive a lot of bug reports. Before opening a new issue, take a moment to browse our [existing issues](https://github.com/apple/swift/issues) to reduce the chance of reporting a duplicate.
