## XCTest

The XCTest library is designed to provide a common framework for writing unit tests in Swift, for Swift packages and applications.

This version of XCTest uses the same API as the XCTest you are familiar with from Xcode. Our goal is to enable your project's tests to run on all Swift platforms without having to rewrite them.

More information about XCTest on Linux is available on our [GitHub project page](http://www.github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest).
