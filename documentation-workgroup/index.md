title: Swift Documentation Workgroup
---

The Documentation Workgroup is a steering team that helps guide the
documentation experience for Swift.

The Documentation Workgroup will:

* Define and prioritize efforts that address the documentation needs of the
  Swift community.
* Actively guide development for documentation tooling such as Swift-DocC.
* Define processes that govern contributions to Swift’s documentation
  experience.
* Channel feedback to Swift Core Team about the needs of the Swift community.

The current Documentation Workgroup consists of the following people:

* [Daniel Grumberg](https://github.com/daniel-grumberg)
* [Dave Verwer](https://github.com/daveverwer)
* [David Rönnqvist](https://github.com/d-ronnqvist)
* [Dianna Ma](https://github.com/tayloraswift)
* [Ethan Kusters](https://github.com/ethan-kusters)
* [Franklin Schrans](https://github.com/franklinsch) (chair)
* [Joe Heck](https://github.com/heckj)
* [Kyle Murray](https://github.com/krilnon)
* [Kyle Ye](https://github.com/Kyle-Ye)
* [Max Obermeier](https://github.com/theMomax)
* [Sven Schmidt](https://github.com/finestructure)
* [Victoria Mitchell](https://github.com/QuietMisdreavus)

## Charter

The main goal of the Documentation Workgroup is to deliver a great
documentation experience to the Swift community. To that end, the workgroup
will develop tooling like Swift-DocC to support the experience it wants to
provide for the ecosystem and future Swift language documentation efforts. Over
time, the workgroup will also help define guidelines for writing quality
documentation and drive a cohesive documentation ecosystem across Swift.

In that capacity, workgroup members review proposals for changes to the
documentation experience, either in pull requests or ideas posted to forums,
and provide feedback in an effort to integrate these changes in a way that is
consistent with the documentation experience’s goals.

Workgroup members may also initiate projects to improve different aspects of
the Swift documentation experience, such as documentation UI/UX
design and the documentation authoring syntax.

Members of the Documentation Workgroup serve at the discretion of the Swift
Core Team and the Swift project lead, who has the ultimate authority over the
workgroup decisions.

## Membership

Members of the Documentation Workgroup provide steerage of Swift’s
documentation experience as outlined in the charter above. If you’d like to
join the workgroup, please reach out to `@swift-documentation-workgroup` in the
forums.

Inactive members that do not participate for three consecutive months will be
contacted to confirm their desire to stay with the group. After no activity for
six months, they will be removed from the group.

The Core Team also selects one member of the workgroup as the chair. The chair
has no special authority over the workgroup, but they are responsible for
ensuring its smooth functioning, including by:

* Organizing and leading regular meetings.
* Ensuring that the workgroup communicates effectively with the community.
* Coordinating meetings between workgroup representatives and the Core Team
  when issues need to be raised to the Core Team.

Workgroup members will try to make a decision independently by consensus
whenever possible, and will raise issues to the Core Team when there are particular
challenges with reaching consensus on significant decisions.

## Communication

The Documentation Workgroup communicates with the broader Swift community using
the [Swift-DocC forum](https://forums.swift.org/c/development/swift-docc) for
general discussions about Swift-DocC. The workgroup can also be contacted
privately by messaging `@swift-documentation-workgroup` on the Swift Forums.

## Community Participation

Everyone is invited to participate in contributing to Swift’s documentation
experience and the Documentation Workgroup’s initiatives. If you’d like to
contribute, consider:

* Joining the Documentation Workgroup’s open meetings on WebEx (reach out to
    `@swift-documentation-workgroup` in forums for details).
* Discussing ideas in the Swift Forums, for example in the [Swift-DocC
  forum](https://forums.swift.org/c/development/swift-docc) for
  Swift-DocC–related ideas.
* Opening issues to track enhancements and bugs for the projects governed by the Documentation Workgroup:
  [Swift-DocC](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc/issues), [The Swift Programming Language book](https://github.com/apple/swift-book/issues).
* Participating in the [Swift Mentorship
  Program](/mentorship).
