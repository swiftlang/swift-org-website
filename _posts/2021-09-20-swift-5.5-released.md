title: Swift 5.5 Released!
author: tkremenek
---

Swift 5.5 is now officially released!  Swift 5.5 is a massive release, which includes newly introduced language capabilities for concurrency, including `async/await`, structured concurrency, and Actors.  My heartfelt thanks to the entire Swift community for all the active discussion, review, and iteration on the concurrency (and other additions) that make up the release.  Thank you!

## How to learn more

An updated version of [The Swift Programming Language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/) for Swift 5.5 is now available on Swift.org. It is also available for free on the [Apple Books store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11).

You can try out some of the new features in this [playground](https://github.com/twostraws/whats-new-in-swift-5-5) put together by Paul Hudson!
