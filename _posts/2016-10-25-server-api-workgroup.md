Since Swift became available on Linux there has been a huge amount of interest in using Swift on the server, resulting in the emergence of a number of Web Frameworks, including Kitura, Vapor, Perfect, and Zewo, along with many others. As an important part of the Swift ecosystem, and one that we are keen to foster, we are today announcing the formation of the Server APIs work group.

The work group provides the framework for participants in the the community with an interest in building server applications and frameworks to come together to work on providing new Swift APIs. These APIs will provide low level "server" functions as the basic building blocks for developing server-side capabilities, removing the reliance on interfacing with generally platform specific C libraries for these functions. This will enable more developers to create frameworks and server applications using pure-Swift code, without the need to also have systems programming skills and knowledge of multiple platforms.

The work group will initially be looking at APIs for networking, security, and HTTP/WebSocket parsing, with the goal of making it possible for anyone to build a simple, secure, HTTP server, or to start to build other server frameworks like pub/sub message brokers.

For more information, take a look at the [Server APIs project page](/sswg/).

> Editor note: The Server APIs Workgroup was renamed to the Swift Server Workgroup. The link in this article has been updated for the new URL.
