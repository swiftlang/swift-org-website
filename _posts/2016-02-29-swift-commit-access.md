title: Expanding Commit Access
author: ematejska

Now that the Swift Continuous Integration system is established and proven, we’d like to grant commit access on a more frequent basis to project contributors who have established a track record of good contributions.  If you would like commit access, please send an email to [the code owners list](mailto:code-owners@swift.org) with a list of 5 non-trivial pull requests that we accepted without modifications.

For more details about what it means to have commit access, please see the [Contributing Code](/contributing/#contributing-code) section.
