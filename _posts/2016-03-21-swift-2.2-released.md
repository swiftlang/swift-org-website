We are very pleased to announce the release of Swift 2.2!  This is the first official release of Swift since it was open-sourced on December 3, 2015.  Notably, the release includes contributions from 212 non-Apple contributors &mdash; changes that span from simple bug fixes to enhancements and alterations to the core language and Swift Standard Library.

### Language Changes

Swift 2.2 is a minor language release that is mostly source-compatible with Swift 2.1.  It contains the following language changes that went through the Swift's [evolution process](/contributing/#participating-in-the-swift-evolution-process):

* [SE-0001: Allow (most) keywords as argument labels](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0001-keywords-as-argument-labels.md)
* [SE-0015: Tuple comparison operators](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0015-tuple-comparison-operators.md)
* [SE-0014: Constraining `AnySequence.init`](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0014-constrained-AnySequence.md)
* [SE-0011: Replace `typealias` keyword with `associatedtype` for associated type declarations](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0011-replace-typealias-associated.md)
* [SE-0021: Naming Functions with Argument Labels](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0021-generalized-naming.md)
* [SE-0022: Referencing the Objective-C selector of a method](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0022-objc-selectors.md)
* [SE-0020: Swift Language Version Build Configuration](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0020-if-swift-version.md)

Beyond these language changes Swift 2.2 also contains numerous bug fixes, enhancements to diagnostics, and produces even faster-running code.

The [Swift Package Manager](/documentation/package-manager/) is still early in development and is not included in this release.

### Documentation

An updated version of [The Swift Programming Language](/documentation/tspl) for Swift 2.2 is now available on Swift.org.  It is also available for free on Apple's iBooks store.

### Platforms

#### Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 15.10)

Swift 2.2 includes support for Swift on Linux.  The Linux port is still relatively new and in this release does not include the [Swift Core Libraries](/documentation/core-libraries/) (which will appear in Swift 3).  The port does, however, include LLDB and the REPL.

Official binaries for Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 15.10 are [available for download](/download/).

#### Apple (Xcode)

For development on Apple's platforms, Swift 2.2 ships as part of [Xcode 7.3](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/).

### Sources

Development on Swift 2.2 was tracked in the `swift-2.2-branch` on the following repositories on GitHub:

* [swift]
* [swift-llvm]
* [swift-clang]
* [swift-lldb]
* [swift-cmark]

The tag `swift-2.2-RELEASE` designates the specific revisions in those repositories that make up the final version of Swift 2.2.

The `swift-2.2-branch` will remain open &mdash; but under the same [release management process](/blog/swift-2-2-release-process/) &mdash; to accumulate changes for a potential future bug-fix "dot" release.
