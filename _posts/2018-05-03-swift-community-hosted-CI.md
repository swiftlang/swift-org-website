title: Swift Community-Hosted Continuous Integration
author: [najacque, shahmishal]

We are delighted to announce a significant expansion of our Swift.org continuous integration testing system.  Members of the Swift community have been hard at work to support Swift on a number of new platforms, and we have extended the Swift CI system to support community-hosted nodes for testing additional platforms.

Community members can volunteer to host nodes for additional platforms and are responsible for maintaining the host system.  New nodes can be initiated by creating a pull request at: [Swift Community-Hosted CI Repository](https://github.com/apple/swift-community-hosted-continuous-integration).  Further information about the process is documented in the [README.md](https://github.com/apple/swift-community-hosted-continuous-integration/blob/master/README.md).

We have worked with several members of the community and are pleased to make CI testing available today for Fedora, and ARMv7 for Debian "Stretch". Check them out at: [Community-Hosted CI](https://ci-external.swift.org).
