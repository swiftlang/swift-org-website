title: Swift 5.7 Released!
author: [hborla]
---

Swift 5.7 is now officially released! Swift 5.7 includes major additions to the language and standard library, enhancements to the compiler for a better developer experience, improvements to tools in the Swift ecosystem including SourceKit-LSP and the Swift Package Manager, refined Windows support, and more.

Swift 5.7 is the culmination of countless contributions from members across the Swift community. Thank you to everyone in the community for your Swift Forum discussions, bug reports, pull requests, educational content, and much more!

If you’re new to Swift, [The Swift Programming Language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/) is the official Swift guide and has been updated for version 5.7. The Swift community maintains a number of [translations](https://www.swift.org/documentation/tspl/#translations). It is also available for free on the [Apple Books store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11).

## Language and Standard Library

The Swift 5.7 language and standard library feature a number of improvements:
  * New shorthand syntax for common boilerplate code, including `if let` statements and multi-statement closure type annotations
  * Lifted long-standing language limitations to make generic programming more seamless
  * Enhanced data race safety with new annotations and opt-in diagnositcs
  * Actor isolation in distributed environments
  * Improved usability of a suite of existing pointer APIs
  * Brand new language support and APIs for string processing

Most of these features were discussed at WWDC22 and were covered in a previous blog post, [Swift language announcements from WWDC22](https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-language-updates-from-wwdc22/). You can also find a complete list of language and standard library Swift Evolution proposals in the [Swift Evolution Appendix](#swift-evolution-appendix).

## Developer Experience

### New Generics Implementation

In addition to the above language improvements for working with generics, the type checker’s generics implementation has been rewritten from scratch with improvements to correctness and performance.

The new implementation fixes many long-standing bugs, mostly related to the handling of complex same-type requirements, such as same-type requirements on a collection’s `SubSequence` associated type, and code making use of the `CaseIterable` protocol which defines the requirement `Self.Element == Self`.

The new generics implementation also improves performance. With certain configurations of protocols and associated types, type checking time would scale exponentially in Swift 5.6, but is now linear in Swift 5.7.

### Automatic Reference Counting Improvements

In Swift 5.7, ARC behavior is more predictable, user-friendly, and performant by specifying new rules to shorten the lifetime of variables when optimization is allowed. To enforce the rules, the compiler adopted a new internal representation that tracks the lexical scope of each variable. This involved updating existing optimizations and implementing several new optimizations. Now, the most common programming patterns that depend on extended variable lifetimes are safe without requiring programmers to explicitly use `withExtendedLifetime()`. This protects you from difficult-to-diagnose lifetime bugs that only appear at runtime in optimized builds. It also allows the introduction of more powerful optimization without breaking existing source.

### Code Completion

Code completion of function call arguments, variables, and global functions is now tightly integrated into Swift’s type checker. This allows code completion to provide more accurate results inside ambiguous code or code with errors.

If completing after the `+` in the following example, code completion now reports `int` and `string` as matching the surrounding context, allowing editors to rank these results higher than `array`.

```swift
func makeIntOrString() -> Int {}
func makeIntOrString() -> String {}

let array = [4, 2]
let int = 42
let string = "Hello World!"
makeIntOrString() +
```

If completing the missing argument in the following example, code completion now only suggests the `secondInt` argument label and omits `secondString`.

```swift
func add(_ firstInt: Int, secondInt: Int) {}
func add(_ firstString: String, secondString: String) {}
add(1, )
```

## Ecosystem

### SourceKit-LSP

SourceKit-LSP received several improvements to support the release of the [Swift for Visual Studio Code extension](https://forums.swift.org/t/introducing-swift-for-visual-studio-code/54246).

Compiler arguments are now recomputed after changes to `Package.swift`, `compile_commands.json`, or `compile_flags.txt`. This ensures that semantic functionality, such as code completion or live issues, continues to work correctly after these changes.

If multiple SwiftPM projects are opened in the same Visual Studio Code workspace, SourceKit-LSP can manage them in a single server instance. The language server no longer needs to be restarted when switching between files from different SwiftPM projects, which reduces the delay until semantic functionality becomes available for a file.

### Swift Package Manager

The following [Swift Evolution](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution) proposals for SwiftPM were accepted and [implemented in Swift 5.7](https://www.swift.org/swift-evolution/#?version=5.7):

* SE-0292: [Package Registry Service](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0292-package-registry-service.md)
* SE-0303: [Build tool plugins](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0303-swiftpm-extensible-build-tools.md) and SE-0332: [Command Plugins](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0332-swiftpm-command-plugins.md) which were first introduced in Swift 5.6 have been further refined and made available via Xcode.
* SE-0339: [Module Aliasing For Disambiguation](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0339-module-aliasing-for-disambiguation.md)

### Distributed Actor Library

Based on SE-0336: [Distributed Actor Isolation](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0336-distributed-actor-isolation.md), a [server library](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-actors) for building distributed systems in Swift has been made open source. The library provides a peer-to-peer cluster actor system implementation, including cluster management, failure detection, and integration with service discovery.

### Windows Platform

Swift 5.7 comes with the following refinements to Windows support:
  * The Windows toolchain has fully adopted swift-driver as the compiler driver, and the C++ driver is no longer packaged nor provided as a fallback.
  * The installer is more robust in deploying module-maps and packaging files, which reduced the size of the installer download.
  * The API digester and other tools have been added in the new smaller download.
  * The SDK layout has been further streamlined by removing unnecessary path components.
  * The developer libraries were restructured to allow multi-architectural installations as work continues to support ARM64 and X86 targets in addition to X64.
  * Initial support for static Swift libraries was implemented for libraries other than the Swift standard library, and can be used with build tools such as CMake and Bazel on Windows.
