We are excited to announce the creation of the [Windows workgroup](/windows-workgroup/)!

The primary goal is to ensure ongoing support for Swift on Windows, enabling users to develop Windows applications using the Swift programming language and its associated tools.

The new Windows workgroup joins a growing list of Swift workgroups, including the [Android workgroup](/android-workgroup/), [Build and Packaging workgroup](/build-and-packaging-workgroup/), and [Testing workgroup](/testing-workgroup/) which were all added in the past year. Swift workgroups are community-led efforts, formally recognized by the project, to help move forward key areas.

Windows has been an [officially supported platform](/blog/swift-on-windows/) since 2020, and there’s been great progress since then. The [VS Code extension](/blog/vscode-extension/) supports Windows, and we’ve seen the community take advantage of Swift’s features on Windows, some of which are described in a 2023 blog post about [Using Interoperability to Build on Windows](/blog/swift-everywhere-windows-interop/ ). The workgroup will build upon these efforts and focus on work to:

* Improve and maintain Windows support for the official Swift distribution.
* Recommend enhancements to core Swift packages such as Foundation and Dispatch to work better with Windows idioms.
* Make recommendations to the Swift Project about the direction of future Windows support in Swift.
* Identify and recommend best practices for bridging between Swift and the Windows API, and for shipping Swift libraries with Windows applications.
