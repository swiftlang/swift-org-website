We're pleased to announce the release of the new [Swift Evolution](https://www.swift.org/swift-evolution/) status page as a one-stop destination for information about proposed changes to Swift.

The Swift.org community has wholeheartedly embraced the [Swift Evolution process](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md)â€”to date, members have contributed to over 100 proposals. Each new proposal generates a burst of activity in the community.

To help make sense of it all, the status page has several ways to navigate through the list of proposals. You can search for specific authors, review managers, and topics by keyword. You can narrow the list to show only the proposals that were implemented in a particular version of Swift. To track a proposal's implementation, the page shows the current state of a proposal's corresponding issues on [bugs.swift.org](https://bugs.swift.org).

The data automatically stays up to date as people make changes to proposals in the [Swift Evolution repository](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution). Simply modify the Markdown for a proposal in a pull request and it'll show up on the status page soon after the request is merged.
