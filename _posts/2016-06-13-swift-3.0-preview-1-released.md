title: Swift 3.0 Preview 1 Released!
author: tkremenek
---

We are very pleased to announce **Developer Preview 1** of Swift 3.0!

As described in the [Swift 3.0 Release Process](/blog/swift-3-0-release-process/), developer previews (i.e., "seeds" or
"betas") provide qualified builds of Swift 3 that are more stable than just
grabbing the latest snapshot of `master` (i.e., tip-of-trunk development).
Developer previews capture Swift 3 as a work-in-progress and should not
be considered the final version of Swift 3 unless otherwise stated.

### Downloads

#### Apple (Xcode)

Swift 3.0 Preview 1 is available for free as part of [Xcode 8 beta 1](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download).

#### Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 15.10)

Official binaries for Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 15.10 are [available for download](/download/) on Swift.org.

### Documentation

An updated version of [The Swift Programming Language](/documentation/tspl) for Swift 3.0 is now available on Swift.org.  It is also available for free on Apple's [iBooks store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-swift-programming-language/id1002622538?mt=11).

### Foundation and Linux (Core Libraries)

Not all of the `NS` prefix removal changes have propagated to the Core Libraries implementation of Foundation APIs.
This should be resolved in a future beta.

### Migrating to Swift 3

Swift 3 is a source-breaking release over Swift 2.2.1.  It contains many syntactic refinements and improvements,
but also a huge number of changes for how Objective-C APIs import into Swift due to [SE-0005](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0005-objective-c-name-translation.md).
Please consult the [migration guide](/migration-guide/) for guidance and tips
for migrating to Swift 3.
