title: 'Introducing Packages on Swift.org'

Today, Swift.org gains a useful, new [top-level Packages page](/packages).

The page provides a streamlined entry to exploring the Swift package ecosystem. It has common categories like [server](/packages/server.html), [networking](/packages/networking.html), [testing](/packages/testing.html), and [logging](/packages/logging.html), as well as categories of interest like [packages containing macros](/packages/macros.html). When you select a category, it provides a sample of some widely-used packages for that category, with information to help you explore further. Itâ€™s a great way to get a sense of the variety of packages available for Swift.

_The package lists give you relevant information at a glance._

The package lists are powered by the [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com/), thanks to the [sponsorship and support of Apple](/blog/swift-package-index-developer-spotlight/).

## Community Showcase

In addition to finding common categories of packages, you can also browse new and interesting work from across the Swift package ecosystem with the [Community Showcase](/packages/showcase.html).

The Community Showcase contains a rotating selection of packages being discussed by the Swift community. Anyone can nominate a package in [this forum thread](https://forums.swift.org/t/nominations-for-the-packages-community-showcase-on-swift-org/68168), and nominations will be reviewed monthly by the [Swift Website Workgroup](/website-workgroup/).

The new [Packages page](/packages) is an exciting step in growing a valuable and thriving package ecosystem for the benefit of all Swift developers.
