Over the past few months, the website workgroup has been redesigning Swift.org. On behalf of the website workgroup, I'm pleased to announce that we have merged the initial changes.

Our goal with the site redesign has been to make Swift.org more approachable for newcomers to Swift, highlight the language’s technical strengths, and make it easy to get started. That led to a focus on the website's appearance, improving the user experience, and emphasizing important features such as Swift’s multiplatform support.

Today's release includes refreshed home and install pages. Additionally, new pages have been designed to explore Swift use cases, including cloud services, command line tools, and embedded software. Looking forward, we plan to take an iterative approach to improving the website, including pushing changes live as we complete their design and implementation.

## Brand new design

We explored several design options and found that the latest design conveys the fluidity and creativity of Swift through the splash of orange and the bird animation in the background.

</div>

## Curated content and examples

The homepage now highlights Swift's strengths alongside code examples that illustrate them. Additionally, we showcase various types of software that can be developed using Swift; these new use case pages provide information such as relevant packages, examples of Swift in action, code snippets, and links to resources for further learning.

## Next Steps

We look forward to hearing your feedback on this first set of changes as we continue to redesign other sections of the site. There are several ways to offer feedback on the redesign and to get involved:

* A [forum announcement](https://forums.swift.org/t/redesigned-swift-org-is-now-live/80296) has been shared on the forums that can be used for discussion, and the website repository has GitHub issues.
* The website itself is open source, and your contributions to the [swiftlang/swift-org-website](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-org-website) repository are welcome.
* [The Swift Information Architecture Project](https://forums.swift.org/t/announcing-the-swift-information-architecture-project/75866) is an ongoing effort that has helped inform decisions related to the site redesign.


Thank you to the website workgroup and community members for contributing to these improvements.
