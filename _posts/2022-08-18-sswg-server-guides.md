title: Server Guides Now on Swift.org
author: 0xTim

The [Swift Server Workgroup](/sswg/) has maintained a set of open source guides for Swift on Server development for a number of years. Now that swift.org is open source, we've [moved the guides to this site](/documentation/server/guides/).

The guides cover a number of useful topics:

 * [Setting up your environment](/documentation/server/guides/setup-and-ide-alternatives.html)
 * [Building]({{site.url}}/documentation/server/guides/building.html) and [testing]({{site.url}}/documentation/server/guides/testing.html)
 * [Profiling]({{site.url}}/documentation/server/guides/performance.html) and [deploying]({{site.url}}/documentation/server/guides/deployment.html) (including AWS, Digital Ocean, Heroku, and GCP)
 * [Docker best practices]({{site.url}}/documentation/server/guides/packaging.html)
 * [Debugging in production]({{site.url}}/documentation/server/guides/llvm-sanitizers.html)

The guides also include a section for library authors, covering best practices for log levels and approaches for adopting Swift concurrency.

If you'd like to contribute to the guides, you can [create an issue](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-org-website/issues/new/choose) or post on [the forums](https://forums.swift.org).
