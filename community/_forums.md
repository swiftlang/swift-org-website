## Forums

The primary method of communicating among community members is through the [Swift forums](https://forums.swift.org).  Within the forums, we have a number of categories and sub-categories, to help organize discussions.  Forum topics can be further organized via use of tags.

In addition to the forum web interface, the forums can be interacted with via email.  Subscriptions and email preferences are configured via forum user settings.

A core principle for the Swift project is that the community is an open and inclusive one.  Engagement on the forums should follow these guidelines:

- All discussion on the forums should adhere to Swift project's [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).

- Different users may have different preferences in choice of language for discussion and are encouraged to use their language of choice.

- As a matter of courtesy, responses to a post should be in the same language as the original post in order to maintain the original inclusiveness of the discussion and not inadvertantly exclude other participants already engaged on the thread (including the author of the original post).

- A response to a post has the option of providing _additional text_ in a different language if that is helpful.
