You'll find networking, testing, UI helpers, logging, animation, and many more packages that work with the [Swift Package Manager]({% link documentation/package-manager/index.md %}) (SwiftPM).

## Create Your Own

Creating a Swift package is a great way to modularise your code either for personal use, for private use inside your company, or to release an open source package for the rest of the Swift community to use.

Start by reading [creating a Swift package](/getting-started/library-swiftpm/), or by watching [Creating Swift Packages](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/410/) from WWDC 2019, or [Meet Swift Package plugins](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110359/) from WWDC 2022.

To make your package easier to find for other members of the community, [add it to the Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com/add-a-package).

## Advanced Search

The [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com/) is a community-run package search engine with powerful filters to help you find what you're looking for. For example, you could search for packages that:

- [Match a search term](https://swiftpackageindex.com/search?query=swiftui)
- [Have compatibility with both iOS and macOS platforms](https://swiftpackageindex.com/search?query=swiftui+platform:ios,macos)
- [Include an executable helper or tool](https://swiftpackageindex.com/search?query=swiftui+product:executable)
- [Have been created by a specific author](https://swiftpackageindex.com/search?query=author:apple)
