  - title: Language Reference
    url: /documentation/tspl/
    description: |
      The Swift Programming Language (TSPL) book is the authoritative reference for Swift,
      offering a guided tour, a comprehensive guide, and a formal reference of the language.
  - title: API Design Guidelines
    url: /documentation/api-design-guidelines/
    description: |
      Delivering a clear, consistent developer experience when writing Swift code is largely defined by the names and idioms that appear in APIs.
      These design guidelines explain how to make sure that your code feels like a part of the larger Swift ecosystem.
  - title: Standard Library
    url: /documentation/standard-library/
    description: |
      The Swift standard library defines a base layer of functionality for writing Swift programs.
  - title: Core Libraries
    url: /documentation/core-libraries/
    description: |
      The Swift Core Libraries project provides higher-level functionality than the Swift standard library.
      These libraries provide powerful tools that developers can depend upon across all the platforms Swift supports.
  - title: Package Manager
    url: /documentation/package-manager/
    description: |
      The Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution and use of "packages" of Swift code.
      It's integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies into target products.
  - title: REPL &  Debugger
    url: /documentation/lldb/
    description: |
      The LLDB debugger provides a rich REPL as well as the debugging environment for the Swift Language.
  - title: About Swift
    url: /about/
    description: |
      A summary of the core features of Swift, supported platforms, and open source projects.

  - title: Swift on Server
    url: /documentation/server/
    description: |
      Swift is a general-purpose programming language with unique characteristics that make it specifically suitable for Server applications.
  - title: Embedded development
    url: /getting-started/embedded-swift/
    description: |
      Introduction to embedded development using Swift. Learn how to get started.
  - title: Mixing Swift and C++
    url: /documentation/cxx-interop/
    description: |
      Swift has support for bidirectional interoperability with C++.
      A great variety of C++ APIs can be called directly from Swift, and select Swift APIs can be used from C++.
  - title: Mixing Strict Memory Safe Swift and C++
    url: /documentation/cxx-interop/safe-interop
    description: |
      Strict memory safe Swift makes code more auditable for memory safety errors by explicitly delineating potentially
      unsafe code from safe code. Using the right annotations we can safely interact with C++ from Swift without the need
      to sprinkle `unsafe` before every C++ construct.
  - title: Value and Reference types
    url: /documentation/articles/value-and-reference-types.html
    description: |
      Types in Swift are grouped in two categories: value types and reference types.
      Each behave differently and understanding the difference is an important part of understanding Swift.
  - title: DocC
    url: /documentation/docc/
    description: |
      DocC is a documentation compiler that makes it easy for you to produce documentation for your Swift frameworks and packages.
      The compiler builds your documentation by combining the comments you write in source with extension files, articles, and tutorials that live alongside your package's source code.
  - title: Enabling Complete Concurrency Checking
    url: /documentation/concurrency/
    description: |
        Prepare for Swift 6 by enabling complete concurrency checking in your SwiftPM packages, Xcode projects, and CI scripts.
  - title: Getting Started with the Static Linux SDK
    url: /documentation/articles/static-linux-getting-started.html
    description: |
      Learn how to get started building binaries for Linux with no system dependencies (not even the Swift runtime or C library).
      Even better, you can do this from any system with a Swift toolchain, allowing you to develop on macOS or Windows and easily deploy to Linux when you go to production.
