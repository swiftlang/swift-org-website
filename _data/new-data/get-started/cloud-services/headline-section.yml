headline: Build & publish containers natively
body: Container images are the standard way to package cloud software today. Once you've packaged your server in a container image, you can deploy it on any container-based public or private cloud service, or run it locally using a desktop container runtime. <br /><br /> Swift Container Plugin allows you to build and publish container images for your Swift services in one streamlined workflow with Swift Package Manager.
