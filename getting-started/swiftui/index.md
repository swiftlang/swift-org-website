title: Build Mobile Apps with Swift
---

Swift is the primary language for building polished, unique apps for iOS,
watchOS, visionOS, and other Apple platforms. With built-in support for app
development in Xcode, as well as powerful libraries like SwiftUI and SwiftData,
Swift is the perfect choice for your next mobile app project.

## Getting started

When building mobile apps with Swift, you'll want a full development
environment, rather than just the Swift compiler. Xcode provides the latest
version of Swift, along with tools for designing and previewing your user
interface, simulators for testing your app, and tools for uploading it to the
App Store.

Xcode is designed for running on Mac, and you can download it for free from [the
Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835).

## Your first app with Swift

There are many great tutorials for learning to develop mobile apps with Swift.
If you're starting a new app, you'll probably want to use SwiftUI, a modern way
to build beautiful user interfaces using declarative Swift code.

If you're already familiar with UI development from other platforms, you may
find the [Introducing SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/)
tutorial a great place to start. This tutorial teaches the fundamentals of Swift
and SwiftUI through development of a sophisticated app with animation, storage
and graphics, and is a good starting point for further learning.

Another great learning resource is Hacking with Swift, a free learning resource
that includes [100 Days of
SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) -- a comprehensive
tutorial to learning Swift development.

Finally, this video provides an overview of the philosophy of SwiftUI and how it
takes advantage of Swift to provide a modern, high-performance framework for
constructing UI:

## Useful packages and libraries

The Swift ecosystem includes a wide variety of packages that are useful for
mobile apps, including:

- [SwiftData](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/), which
  enables you to add data persistence to your app easily.
- [Swift Charts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts), a powerful
  package for transforming data into beautiful visualizations.
- [MapKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/), which brings
  powerful mapping and satellite imagery into your app.

## What about other platforms?

SwiftUI is written with Apple platforms in mind, but it's possible to use Swift
to build mobile apps for other platforms too. Tools from other companies like
[Skip](https://skip.tools) provide support for running Swift on Android.
