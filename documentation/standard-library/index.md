The Swift standard library defines a base layer of functionality for writing Swift programs.
Documentation for the standard library is presently hosted on the [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/swift-standard-library).

The Swift standard library, along with its tests and inline documentation,
are a part of the [main Swift repository][swift-repo].
