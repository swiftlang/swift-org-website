## Standard Library Design

The Swift standard library encompasses a number of data types,
protocols and functions, including fundamental data types (e.g.,
`Int`, `Double`), collections (e.g., `Array`, `Dictionary`) along with
the protocols that describe them and algorithms that operate on them,
characters and strings, and low-level primitives (e.g.,
`UnsafeMutablePointer`). The implementation of the standard library
resides in the `stdlib/public` subdirectory within the [Swift
repository][swift-repo], which is further subdivided into:

* **Standard library core**: The core of the standard library (implemented in [stdlib/public/core](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/main/stdlib/public/core)), including the definitions of all of the data types, protocols, functions, etc.

* **Runtime**: The language support runtime (implemented in [stdlib/public/runtime](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/main/stdlib/public/runtime)), which is layered between the compiler and the core standard library. It is responsible for implementing many of the dynamic features of the language, such as casting (e.g., for the `as!` and `as?` operators), type metadata (to support generics and reflection), and memory management (object allocation, reference counting, etc.). Unlike higher-level libraries, the runtime is written mostly in C++ or (where needed for interoperability) Objective-C.

* **SDK Overlays**: Specific to Apple platforms, the SDK overlays (implemented in [stdlib/public/Platform](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/main/stdlib/public/Platform)) provide Swift-specific additions and modifications to existing Objective-C frameworks to improve their mapping into Swift. In particular, the `Foundation` overlay provides additional support for interoperability with Objective-C code.

The Swift standard library is written in Swift, but because it is the lowest-level Swift code in the stack---responsible for implementing the core data types on which other Swift code is built---it is a bit different from normal Swift code. Some of the differences include:

* **Access to compiler builtins**: The `Builtin` module, which is only generally accessible to the standard library, provides compiler builtin functions (e.g., to directly create SIL instructions) and data types (e.g., "raw" pointers, primitive LLVM integer types) needed to implement the data types that are fundamental to programming in Swift.

* **Visibility is often managed by convention**: Standard library declarations often need to have greater visibility than one would generally like, due to the way in which the standard library is compiled and optimized. For example, `private` modifiers are never used. More importantly, it is common to need to make something `public` even when it is not intended as part of the public interface. In such cases, one should use a leading underscore to indicate that the public API is meant to be private. The policy for access control in the standard library is documented in [docs/AccessControlInStdlib.rst](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/AccessControlInStdlib.rst).

* **Repetitive code uses gyb**: [gyb](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/utils/gyb.py) is a simple tool for generating repetitive code from a template that is used often in the standard library. For example, it is used to create the definitions of the various sized integer types (`Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`, etc.) from a single source.

* **Testing is tightly coupled with the compiler**: The standard library and the compiler evolve together and are tightly coupled. Changes in core data types (e.g., `Array` or `Int`) can require compiler-side changes, and vice-versa, so the standard library test suite is stored within the same directory structure as the compiler, in [test/stdlib](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/main/test/stdlib) and [validation-test/stdlib](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/main/validation-test/stdlib).
