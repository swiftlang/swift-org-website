## Introduction

This document describes the additional memory safety features that Swift
provides when interoperating with C and C++. It describes the ways to make Swift
aware of certain memory safety aspects of your codebase, as well as how Swift
uses that knowledge to prevent common memory safety issues in your code.

<div class="info" markdown="1">
C++ interoperability is an actively evolving feature of Swift.
Future releases of Swift might change how Swift and C++
interoperate,
as the Swift community gathers feedback from real world adoption of C++
interoperability in mixed Swift and C++ codebases.
Please provide the feedback that you have on the

## Overview

Swift provides memory safety with a combination of language affordances and runtime checking.
However, Swift also deliberately includes some unsafe constructs, such as the `UnsafePointer` and `UnsafeMutablePointer`
types in the standard library.
In some cases, Swift needs additional information that is not present in the C++ type and API declarations
to safely interface with them. This document describes how such code needs to be annotated so that it can be used in strict safety mode.

### Annotating Foreign Types

Normally, C++ types imported into Swift are assumed to not impact Swift's memory
safety, and can be used without safety-related restrictions. However, a small
set of C++ APIs e.g. pointers/references and methods returning pointers will be
imported as unsafe (section [Working with C++ references and view types in Swift](https://www.swift.org/documentation/cxx-interop/#working-with-c-references-and-view-types-in-swift)
explains this in more detail.) Under the strict memory safety mode, the compiler will flip the polarity of its safety assumptions.
It will treat all types that are not known to be safe as unsafe, and emit diagnostics for usage of unsafe types without the `unsafe` keyword.
In this section,
we will show how to annotate unsafe C++ types so that they can be accessed safely and correctly from Swift.
Note that the features here are agnostic to whether strict safety mode is on or off. When the strict safety
mode is on, the compiler diagnostics can serve as a guide on how to properly annotate C++ types, and also help ensure
that the code doesn't use unsafe APIs anywhere. When the strict safety mode is turned off, it is still
recommended to adopt these annotation wherever appropriate, especially on C++ types that are potentially
dependent on the lifetimes of other objects.

Under the strict safety mode, built-in numeric types like `int`, some standard library types like `std::string`,
and aggregate types built from other safe types are considered safe. All other unannotated types
are considered unsafe.

Let's see what happens when we are trying to use an unannotated type in
strict safety mode. Consider the following C++ type and APIs:

```c++
struct StringRef {
public:
    ...
private:
    const char *ptr;
    size_t len;
};

std::string normalize(const std::string &path);

StringRef fileName(const std::string &normalizedPath);
```

Let's try to use them from Swift with strict memory safety enabled:

```swift
func getFileName(_ path: borrowing std.string) -> StringRef {
    let normalizedPath = normalize(path)
    return fileName(normalizedPath)
}
```

Building this code will emit a warning that the `fileName` call is unsafe because
it references the unsafe type `StringRef`. Swift considers `StringRef` unsafe because
it has a pointer member. Pointers in types like `StringRef` can dangle, so we need to take extra
care that the buffer they point to outlives the `StringRef` object they are encapsulated by.

Swift's [non-escapable types](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0446-non-escapable.md)
can have lifetime dependencies. The Swift compiler can track these dependencies
and enforce safety at compile time. To import `StringRef` as a safe type, we
need to mark it as a non-escapable type by annotating the class definition:

```c++
struct SWIFT_NONESCAPABLE StringRef { ... };
```

Now the Swift compiler imports `StringRef` as a safe type and no longer
emits a warning about using an unsafe type.

### Annotating C++ APIs

Building the code again will emit a new diagnostic for the `fileName` function about
missing lifetime annotations. C and C++ functions that return non-escapable types need annotations
to describe their lifetime contracts via [lifetimebound](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AttributeReference.html#id8)
and [lifetime_capture_by](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AttributeReference.html#lifetime-capture-by) annotations.

```c++
StringRef fileName(const std::string &normalizedPath [[clang::lifetimebound]]);
```

Adding this annotation to `fileName` indicates that the returned `StringRef` value has the
same lifetime as the argument of the `fileName` function.

Building the project again reveals a lifetime error in the Swift function that calls `fileName`:

```swift
func getFileName(_ path: borrowing std.string) -> StringRef {
    let normalizedPath = normalize(path)
    return fileName(normalizedPath)
    // error: lifetime-dependent value escapes local scope
    // note: depends on `normalizedPath`
}
```

The value returned by `fileName` will dangle after the lifetime of
`normalizedPath` ends. We can fix this error by making the caller of
`getFileName` normalize the path prior to calling `getFileName`:

```swift
// Path needs to be normalized.
func getFileName(_ normalizedPath: borrowing std.string) -> StringRef {
    return fileName(normalizedPath)
}
```

Alternatively, we could construct and return an `Escapable` value of type such
as `std.string` instead of a dangling `StringRef`:

```swift
func getFileName(_ path: borrowing std.string) -> std.string {
    let normalizedPath = normalize(path)
    let ref = fileName(normalizedPath)
    return ref.toString()
}
```

After annotating the C++ code, the Swift compiler can enforce those lifetime
contracts and help us to write code that is free of memory safety errors.

## Escapability Annotations in Detail

Under the strict safety mode, even though compiler warns us when importing
unannotated types, they are still imported as if they are `Escapable` to
maintain backward compatibility. This behavior might change in the future under
a new interoperability version.

We have already seen that we can import a type as `~Escapable` to Swift by adding
the `SWIFT_NONESCAPABLE` annotation:

```c++
struct SWIFT_NONESCAPABLE View {
    View(const int *p) : member(p) {}
private:
    const int *member;
};
```

Moreover, we can explicitly mark types as `Escapable` using the `SWIFT_ESCAPABLE`
annotation to express that they are not lifetime dependent on any other values:

```c++
struct SWIFT_ESCAPABLE Owner { ... }; 
```

The main reason for explicitly annotating a type as `SWIFT_ESCAPABLE` is to make sure
it is considered a safe type when used from Swift. Functions returning escapable
types do not need lifetime annotations.

Escapability annotations can also be attached to types via [API Notes](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/APINotes.html):

```
Tags:
- Name: NonEscapableType
  SwiftEscapable: false
- Name: EscapableType
  SwiftEscapable: true
```

In case of template instantiations the escapability of a type can depend on the
template arguments:

```c++
MyList<View> f();
MyList<Owner> g();
```

In this example, `MyList<View>` should be imported as `~Escapable` while `MyList<Owner>`
should be imported as `Escapable`. This can be achieved via conditional escapability
annotations:

```c++
template<typename T>
struct SWIFT_ESCAPABLE_IF(T) MyList {
    ...
};
```

Here, instantiations of `MyList` are imported as `Escapable` when `T` is substituted
with an `Escapable` type.

The `SWIFT_ESCAPABLE_IF` macro can take multiple template parameters:

```c++
template<typename F, typename S>
struct SWIFT_ESCAPABLE_IF(F, S) MyPair {
    F first;
    S second;
};
```

`MyPair` instantiations are only imported as `Escapable` if both template arguments
are `Escapable`.

`Escapable` types cannot have `~Escapable` fields. The following code snippet will
trigger a compiler error:

```c++
struct SWIFT_NONESCAPABLE View { ... };
struct SWIFT_ESCAPABLE Owner { 
    View v;
}; 
```

Escapability annotations will not only help the Swift compiler to import C++ types
safely, it will also help discover missing lifetime annotations as all `~Escapable`
parameters and return values need to be annotated in an API to make its use safe in
Swift.

## Lifetime Annotations in Detail

The `lifetimebound` attribute on a function parameter or implicit object parameter
indicates that the returned object's lifetime could end when any of the `lifetimebound`
annotated parameters' lifetime ended.
Annotating the parameters of a constructor describes the lifetime of the created object:

```c++
struct SWIFT_NONESCAPABLE View {
    View(const int *p [[clang::lifetimebound]]) : member(p) {}
    ...
};
```

In this example, the object initialized by the `View` constructor has the same
lifetime as the argument `p` of the constructor.

When the attribute is written after the method signature, the returned object has
the same lifetime as the implicit `this` parameter.

```c++
struct Owner {
    int data;

    View handOutView() const [[clang::lifetimebound]] {
        return View(&data);
    }
};
```

For a call site like:
```c++
View v = o.handOutView()
```
the `v` object has the same lifetime as `o`.

In case the attribute is applied to a subset of the parameters, the return
value might depend on the corresponding arguments:

```c++
View getOneOfTheViews(const Owner &owner1 [[clang::lifetimebound]],
                      const Owner &owner2,
                      View view1 [[clang::lifetimebound]],
                      View view2 [[clang::lifetimebound]]) {
    if (coinFlip)
        return View(&owner1.data);
    if (coinFlip)
        return view1;
    else
        return view2;
}
```

Here, the returned `View`'s lifetime depends on `owner`, `view1`, and `view2` but not on `owner2`.

Occasionally, a function might return a non-escapable type that has no dependency on any other values.
These types might point to static data or might represent an empty sequence or lack of data.
Such functions need to be annotated with `SWIFT_RETURNS_INDEPENDENT_VALUE`:

```c++
View returnsEmpty() SWIFT_RETURNS_INDEPENDENT_VALUE {
    return View();
}
```

Notably, the default constructor of a type is always assumed to create an independent value.

We can also attach `lifetimebound` annotations to C and C++ APIs using [API Notes](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/APINotes.html). The `-1` index represents the `this` position.

```
Tags:
- Name: MyClass
  Methods:
    - Name: annotateThis
      Parameters:
        - Position:      -1
          Lifetimebound: true
    - Name: methodToAnnotate
      Parameters:
        - Position:      0
          Lifetimebound: true
```

Note that API Notes have some limitations around C++, they do not support overloaded functions.

While `lifetimebound` always describes the lifetime dependencies of the return value (or
the constructed object in case of constructors), we can use can use the [`lifetime_capture_by`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AttributeReference.html#lifetime-capture-by)
annotation to describe the lifetime of other output values, like output/inout arguments
or globals.

```c++
void copyView(View view1 [[clang::lifetime_capture_by(view2)]], View &view2) {
    view2 = view1;
}
```

Here, `view2` inherits the lifetime dependencies of `view1`, so callers of `copyView` must ensure that whatever they pass as `view2` does not outlive `view1`.

We can use this annotation to specify that a parameter's lifetime dependencies are captured by the implicit `this` object, or
conversely, that an inout argument captures the lifetime dependencies of `this`:

```c++
struct SWIFT_NONESCAPABLE CaptureView {
private:
    View containedView;

public:
    void captureView(View v [[clang::lifetime_capture_by(this)]]) {
        containedView = v;
    }

    void handOut(View &v) const [[clang::lifetime_capture_by(v)]] {
       v = containedView; 
    }
};
```

All of the non-escapable arguments need lifetime annotations for a function to be
considered safe. If an input never escapes from the called function we can use
the `noescape` annotation:

```c++
void is_palindrome(std::span<int> s [[clang::noescape]]);
```

The lifetime annotations presented in this sections are powerful,
but there are still lifetime contracts that they cannot express.
APIs with such contracts can still be used from Swift,
but they are imported as unsafe APIs, so that developers are aware
that they need to take extra care when using these APIs to avoid memory safety violations.

## Convenience Overloads for Annotated Spans and Pointers

C++ APIs often feature parameters that denote a span of memory.
For example, some might have two parameters where one points to a memory buffer
and the other designates the buffer's size; others might use the
[`std::span`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/span) type from the
C++ standard library. When such APIs are appropriately annotated, the Swift
compiler can bridge those span-like parameters to Swift's
[`Span`](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0447-span-access-shared-contiguous-storage.md)
and [`MutableSpan`](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0467-MutableSpan.md)
types, and the user with a safe and convenient interface to those imported APIs.

### C++ `std::span` Support

APIs taking or returning C++'s `std::span` with sufficient lifetime
annotations will automatically get safe overloads take or return Swift
`Span` and `MutableSpan` types.

The following table summarizes the generated convenience overloads:

```c++
using IntSpan = std::span<const int>;
using IntVec = std::vector<int>;
```

| C++ API                                                   | Generated Swift overload                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `void takeSpan(IntSpan x [[clang::noescape]]);`           | `func takeSpan(_ x: Span<Int32>)`                                    |
| `IntSpan changeSpan(IntSpan x [[clang::lifetimebound]]);` | `@lifetime(x) func changeSpan(_ x: Span<Int32>) -> Span<Int32>`      |
| `IntSpan changeSpan(IntVec &x [[clang::lifetimebound]]);` | `@lifetime(x) func changeSpan(_ x: borrowing IntVec) -> Span<Int32>` |
| `IntSpan Owner::getSpan() [[clang::lifetimebound]];`      | `@lifetime(self) func getSpan() -> Span<Int32>`                      |

These transformations only support top-level `std::span`s. The compiler
currently does not transform nested `std::span`s. A `std::span<T>` of a non-const
type `T` is transformed to `MutableSpan<T>` on the Swift side.
