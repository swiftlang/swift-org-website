Swift [supports](/documentation/cxx-interop) bidirectional interoperability with C++. This page
describes which C++ interoperability features are currently supported.
It also talks about the limitations
in the current support for C++ interoperability. Additionally, it lists the set
of constraints that are related to C++ interoperability support.

C++ interoperability is an actively evolving feature of Swift.
Certain
aspects of its design and functionality might change in future releases of
Swift, as the Swift community gathers feedback from real world adoption of C++
interoperability in mixed Swift and C++ codebases.
This page is going to be updated
whenever a new release of Swift changes the supported set of C++
interoperability features.

## Platform Support

C++ interoperability is supported for development and deployment
on [all platforms that Swift supports](/platform-support/).

### Minimum Deployment Version for Mixed-Language Application

C++ interoperability does not impose additional deployment version
requirements for your application, except when your Swift code
uses
[C++ classes or structures that become reference types](#minimum-deployment-version-for-reference-types-imported-from-c).
The minimum deployment version for an application that does not use such
reference types is the same as Swift's regular
[minimum deployment version](/platform-support#minimum-deployment-version).

#### Minimum Deployment Version for Reference Types Imported from C++

The table below shows the minimum OS version for which a mixed Swift and
C++ application that uses [C++ classes or structures that become reference types](/documentation/cxx-interop#mapping-c-types-to-swift-reference-types)
can be deployed. Any deployment platform not listed in the table below
is supported automatically, so the imported reference types do not
impose addition deployment version requirements for platforms like Ubuntu or CentOS.

| Platform running Swift application  | Minimum deployment version |
| ------------------------- | ------------- |
| **macOS**    | 13.3  |
| **iOS**  | 16.4 |
| **watchOS**   | 9.4  |
| **tvOS**   | 16.4  |

### Compiler Support

C++ interoperability is supported in Swift 5.9 and above.

Swift's support for bidirectional interoperability relies on a header
generated by the Swift compiler that can then be included by C++ code that
wants to use Swift APIs. This header uses Swift-specific compiler extensions
that are supported only by the following C++ compilers:

- [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) (starting with LLVM 11 and above)
- Apple Clang

C++ code built with other compilers cannot call Swift functions or use Swift
types from C++.

### C++ Standard Library Support

Swift compiler uses the platform's default C++ standard library when
interoperating with C++.
This table shows which C++ standard library is used when building Swift
code for a specific deployment platform:

| Platform running Swift application  | Default C++ Standard Library |
| ------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Apple platforms**     | libc++  |
| **Ubuntu, CentOS, Amazon Linux**  | libstdc++ |
| **Windows**   | Microsoft C++ Standard Library (msvcprt)  |

Swift does not currently support selecting an alternative standard library for
platforms that support alternative standard libraries. For example, you can't use
libc++ when building Swift code for Ubuntu, even though libc++ can be used when
building C++ code for Ubuntu.

Mixed Swift and C++ code must use
the same C++ standard library.

## Supported C++ APIs

This section describes which C++ APIs are supported in Swift.

### C++ Functions Supported in Swift

Swift supports calling most non-templated:

- Top-level functions
- Functions inside of namespaces
- Member functions, both instance and static
- Virtual member functions of C++ types that become reference types
- Constructors
- Operators
  - Arithmetic operators, like `operator+`, `operator-`, `operator*`
  - Pre-increment operator `operator++` is represented as `func successor() -> Self`
  - Call operator `T operator(Param p)` is represented as `func callAsFunction(p: Param) -> T`
  - Bool literal conversion operator `operator bool` is represented as a convenience initializer `Bool(fromCxx:)`

Functions and constructors that use r-value reference types are not
yet available in Swift. 

Swift supports calling some C++ function templates. Any function or
function template that uses a dependent type in its signature, or a universal
reference (`T &&`) is not available in Swift. Any function template with
non-type template parameters is not available in Swift. Variadic function
templates are not available in Swift.

A C++ function whose return type is
not supported in Swift, or with a parameter whose type is
not supported in Swift is not available in Swift.

If a parameter of a C++ function has a default value, the parameter will also have a default value in Swift if:
- The function is not a constructor
- The parameter is not `inout` in Swift
- The parameter is not a pointer
- The parameter is not a const reference 

### C++ Types Supported in Swift

The following C++ types can be used in Swift:

- Primitive types, like `int` and `bool`
- Pointers
- C++ references, excluding r-value reference / universal reference parameters
- Type aliases, only when the underlying type is supported in Swift
- Copyable structures and classes
- Movable non-copyable structures and classes
- Enumerations, including scoped enumerations (`enum class`)

C++ types that become value types in Swift can be constructed and passed around
by value.

C++ types that become reference types can't be constructed directly by
Swift code. They can be passed around freely between Swift and C++.

C++ types defined inside of a C++ `namespace` are available in 
Swift.

Class and structure templates are not directly available in Swift. The
instantiated specializations of a class or structure template are available
in Swift. Swift code can access template specialization types by [using a type
alias defined in a C++ header](/documentation/cxx-interop#using-class-templates).

Public data members of a C++ structure or class are available in Swift when the
type of such data member is supported in Swift.

### C++ Standard Library Types Supported in Swift

The following C++ standard library types are supported in Swift:

- `std::string`, `std::u16string`, `std::u32string`
- Specializations of `std::pair`
- Specializations of `std::vector`
- Specializations of `std::map` and `std::unordered_map`
- Specializations of `std::set`, `std::multiset` and `std::unordered_set`
- Specializations of `std::optional`
- Specializations of `std::shared_ptr`
- Specializations of `std::array`

Other standard library types, like `std::unique_ptr`, `std::function` and
`std::variant` are not yet supported in Swift.

### Other C++ Features Handled by Swift

#### C++ Exceptions

Swift can interoperate with C++ code that throws exceptions. However, Swift
does not support catching C++ exceptions. Instead, the running program
terminates with a fatal
error when a C++ exception that's not caught by C++ code reaches Swift code.

Swift's strict program termination enforcement for any uncaught exceptions is
currently not supported when running Swift code built with Swift on Windows. Any
mixed language program running on Windows should always terminate when a
C++ exception propagates through Swift code as the program's stack is
unwound. Any attempt to recover from such uncaught exception can lead to
undefined behavior in your program.

#### Clang's Availability Attributes

C++ APIs annotated with Clang's 
[availability attributes](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AttributeReference.html#availability) receive the same availability annotation in Swift.

## Supported Swift APIs

This section describes which Swift APIs get exposed to C++ in the generated
header.

### Swift Structures Supported by C++

Swift can generate C++ representation for most top-level Swift structures. The
following Swift structures are not yet supported:

- Zero-sized structures that don't have any stored properties
- Non-copyable structures
- Generic structures with generic constraints, or with more than three generic
  parameters, or that have variadic generics

Swift currently does not expose nested structures to C++.

### Swift Classes and Actors Supported by C++

Swift can generate C++ representation for most top-level Swift classes and
actors. The
following Swift classes are not yet supported:

- Generic classes and actors

Swift currently does not expose nested classes and actors to C++.

### Swift Enumerations Supported by C++

Swift can generate C++ representation for most top-level Swift enumerations
that do not have associated values, and some top-level Swift enumerations
that have associated values. The
following Swift enumerations are not yet supported:

- Non-copyable enumerations
- Generic enumerations with generic constraints, or with more than three generic
  parameters, or that have variadic generics
- Enumerations that have an enumeration case with more than one associated
  value
- Indirect enumerations

Additionally, the types of all the associated values of an enumeration must be
representable in C++. The exact set of representable types is described
below, in the section that describes the representable
[parameter or return types](#swift-functions-and-properties-supported-by-c). 

Swift currently does not expose nested enumerations to C++.

### Swift Functions and Properties Supported by C++

Any function, property, or initializer is exposed to C++ only when Swift can
represent all of its parameter and return types in C++. A parameter or return
type can be represented in C++ only when:

- it is a supported Swift structure / class / enumeration that is defined
  in the same Swift module.
- or, it is a C++ structure / class / enumeration that is not annotated as a reference type.
- or, it is one of the
  [supported Swift standard library types](#supported-swift-standard-library-types).
  - if it's a generic type, like `Array`, its generic parameters must be bound
    to one of the types listed here.
- or, it is an `UnsafePointer` / `UnsafeMutablePointer` /
  `Optional<UnsafePointer>` / `Optional<UnsafeMutablePointer>` 
  that points to
  any type from the supported three type categories listed above.
  
Functions or initializers that have a parameter type or a return type that's
not listed above cannot be represented in C++ yet. Properties of type
that's not listed above cannot be represented in C++ yet.

Additionally, the following Swift functions, properties and initializers can
not yet be represented in C++:

- Asynchronous functions / properties
- Functions / properties / initializers that `throw`
- Generic functions / properties / initializers with generic constraints
  or variadic generics
- Functions that return an
  [opaque type](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/opaquetypes)
- Functions that return multiple values
- Functions / properties / initializers with the `@_alwaysEmitIntoClient`
  attribute

### Supported Swift Standard Library Types

Swift is able to represent the following Swift standard library types in C++:

- Primitive types, such as `Bool`, `Int`, `Float` and
  their C variants like `CInt`
  - The
    [full list of supported primitive types](#list-of-primitive-swift-types-supported-by-c)
    is provided below.
- Pointer types, like `OpaquePointer`, `UnsafePointer`,
  `UnsafeMutablePointer`, `UnsafeRawPointer` and `UnsafeMutableRawPointer`
- `String` type
- `Array` type
- `Optional` type

For more details on using Swift types like `String` in C++, check out
the section that describes how to
[use Swift standard library types from C++](/documentation/cxx-interop#using-swift-standard-library-types-from-c).

Note that Swift tuples are not currently supported in C++.

## Constraints and Limitations

Swift has some known limitations related to C++ interoperability support.
They're currently [listed on GitHub](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/issues/66159).

### Swift Package Manager Constraints

A Swift target that enables C++ interoperability in Swift Package Manager
[requires](project-build-setup#vending-packages-that-enable-c-interoperability)
its dependencies to enable C++ interoperability as well.
A Swift GitHub issue tracks the status of this constraint:

- [Swift should provide support for internal imports and resilience for all platforms (that can be enabled in SwiftPM) to allow Swift modules to depend on C++ modules without requiring that the clients enable C++ interoperability](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/issues/66156)

### Performance Constraints

Swift's current
[support for C++ container types](/documentation/cxx-interop#working-with-c-containers) 
does not provide explicit
performance guarantees. Most notably, Swift can make a deep copy of a
collection when it's used in a `for-in` loop in Swift.

The following issue tracks the status of this performance constraint:

- [Swift should provide language affordances that make it possible to avoid copying a C++ container when traversing through it in a for-in loop, or when using collection methods like map and filter](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/issues/66158)

### Compatibility with Existing Codebases That Use C or Objective-C APIs in Swift

Enabling C++ interoperability in an existing codebase that imports and
uses C or Objective-C APIs in Swift could cause some source breakages in Swift.
Even though C++ is largely source compatible with C, there are several cases where C++
diverges. Some common cases of divergences that could cause Swift fail
to import C or Objective-C headers in C++ mode are listed below:

- C++ uses a broader set of keywords that may conflict with existing C or
  Objective-C APIs. For example, a C function one of whose parameters is
  named `class` is not a valid C++ function.
- Existing C or Objective-C headers might try to import another Clang module
  inside of an `extern "C"` block. That's not allowed in C++ mode. 
  
In cases like this you're advised to fix these issues in
your C or Objective-C headers. If these headers come from a dependency
that you don't control, you should report an issue to the vendor that vends
these headers.

Some existing codebases that use functions from the platform's C standard library
could see ambiguity errors related to such functions being also defined in
the C++ standard library. Swift prefers to use math functions like `sin`
and `pow` from the C standard library. Some other functions that
Swift doesn't know about could still cause an error. In cases where
you see such an error related to an ambiguity of a function from the
platform's C standard library you can resolve it by using an explicit module qualifier
from Swift when calling such function.
