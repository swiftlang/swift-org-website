## Swift Testing

Swift Testing is a package with expressive and intuitive APIs that make testing your Swift code a breeze.

It provides detailed output when a test fails using macros like `#expect`. And it scales to large codebases with features like parameterization to easily repeat a test with different arguments.

If you already have tests written using XCTest, you can run them side-by-side with newer tests written using Swift Testing. This helps you migrate tests incrementally, at your own pace.

More information about Swift Testing is available on our [GitHub project page](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-testing).
