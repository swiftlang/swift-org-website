## Compiler Architecture

As a whole, the Swift compiler is principally responsible for
translating Swift source code into efficient, executable machine
code. However, the Swift compiler front-end also supports a number of
other tools, including IDE integration with syntax coloring, code
completion, and other conveniences. This document provides a
high-level description of the major components of the Swift compiler:

* **Parsing**: The parser is a simple, recursive-descent parser
  (implemented in
  [lib/Parse](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/tree/main/lib/Parse))
  with an integrated, hand-coded lexer. The parser is responsible for
  generating an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) without any semantic or
  type information, and emits warnings or errors for grammatical problems
  with the input source.

* **Semantic analysis**: Semantic analysis (implemented in
  [lib/Sema](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/tree/main/lib/Sema)) is
  responsible for taking the parsed AST and transforming it into a
  well-formed, fully-type-checked form of the AST, emitting warnings
  or errors for semantic problems in the source code. Semantic
  analysis includes type inference and, on success, indicates that it
  is safe to generate code from the resulting, type-checked AST.

* **Clang importer**: The Clang importer (implemented in
  [lib/ClangImporter](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/tree/main/lib/ClangImporter))
  imports [Clang modules](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/Modules.html) and
  maps the C or Objective-C APIs they export into their corresponding
  Swift APIs. The resulting imported ASTs can be referred to by semantic analysis.

* **SIL generation**: The Swift Intermediate Language (SIL) is a
  high-level, Swift-specific intermediate language suitable for
  further analysis and optimization of Swift code. The SIL generation
  phase (implemented in
  [lib/SILGen](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/tree/main/lib/SILGen))
  lowers the type-checked AST into so-called "raw" SIL.  The design of
  SIL is described in
  [docs/SIL.rst](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/blob/main/docs/SIL.rst).

* **SIL guaranteed transformations**: The SIL guaranteed
    transformations (implemented in
    [lib/SILOptimizer/Mandatory](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/tree/main/lib/SILOptimizer/Mandatory))
    perform additional dataflow diagnostics that
    affect the correctness of a program (such as a use of
    uninitialized variables). The end result of these transformations
    is "canonical" SIL.

* **SIL optimizations**: The SIL optimizations (implemented in
    [lib/SILOptimizer/Analysis](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/tree/main/lib/SILOptimizer/Analysis),
    [lib/SILOptimizer/ARC](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/tree/main/lib/SILOptimizer/ARC),
    [lib/SILOptimizer/LoopTransforms](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/tree/main/lib/SILOptimizer/LoopTransforms), and
    [lib/SILOptimizer/Transforms](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/tree/main/lib/SILOptimizer/Transforms))
    perform additional high-level, Swift-specific optimizations to the
    program, including (for example) Automatic Reference Counting
    optimizations, devirtualization, and generic specialization.

* **LLVM IR generation**: IR generation (implemented in
    [lib/IRGen](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/tree/main/lib/IRGen))
    lowers SIL to [LLVM IR](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html), at
    which point [LLVM](http://llvm.org) can continue to optimize it
    and generate machine code.
