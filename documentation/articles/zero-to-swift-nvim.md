title: Configuring Neovim for Swift Development
author: [etcwilde]
---

[Neovim](https://neovim.io) is a modern reimplementation of _Vim_, a popular terminal-based text
editor.
Neovim adds new features like asynchronous operations and powerful Lua bindings
for a snappy editing experience, in addition to the improvements _Vim_ brings to
the original _Vi_ editor.

This article walks you through configuring Neovim for Swift development,
providing configurations for various plugins to build a working Swift editing
experience.
The configuration files are built up step by step and the end of the article contains the
fully assembled versions of those files.
It is not a tutorial on how to use Neovim and assumes some familiarity
with modal text editors like _Neovim_, _Vim_, or _Vi_.
We are also assuming that you have already installed a Swift toolchain on your
computer. If not, please see the
[Swift installation instructions](https://www.swift.org/install).

Although the article references Ubuntu 22.04, the configuration itself works on
any operating system where a recent version of Neovim and a Swift toolchain is
available.

Basic setup and configuration includes:

1. Installing Neovim.
2. Installing `lazy.nvim` to manage our plugins.
3. Configuring the SourceKit-LSP server.
4. Setting up Language-Server-driven code completion with _nvim-cmp_.
5. Setting up snippets with _LuaSnip_.

The following sections are provided to help guide you through the setup:

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Package Management](#packaging-with-lazy)
- [Language Server Support](#language-server-support)
    - [File Updates](#file-updating)
- [Code Completion](#code-completion)
- [Snippets](#Snippets)
- [Fully Assembled Configuration Files](#files)

> Tip: If you already have Neovim, Swift, and a package manager installed, you can skip to setting up [Language Server support](#language-server-support).

> Note: If you are bypassing the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section, make sure your
copy of Neovim is version v0.9.4 or higher, or you may experience issues with some
of the Language Server Protocol (LSP) Lua APIs.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need to install Neovim. The Lua
APIs exposed by Neovim are under rapid development. We will want to take
advantage of the recent improvements in the integrated support for Language
Server Protocol (LSP), so we will need a fairly recent version
of Neovim.

I'm running Ubuntu 22.04 on an `x86_64` machine. Unfortunately, the
version of Neovim shipped in the Ubuntu 22.04 `apt` repository is too old to
support many of the APIs that we will be using.

For this install, I used `snap` to install Neovim v0.9.4.
Ubuntu 24.04 has a new enough version of Neovim, so a normal
`apt install neovim` invocation will work.
For installing Neovim on other operating systems and Linux distributions,
please see the
[Neovim install page](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

```console
 $  sudo snap install nvim --classic
 $  nvim --version
NVIM v0.9.4
Build type: RelWithDebInfo
LuaJIT 2.1.1692716794
Compilation: /usr/bin/cc -O2 -g -Og -g -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Wno-unused-pa...

   system vimrc file: "$VIM/sysinit.vim"
  fall-back for $VIM: "/usr/share/nvim"

Run :checkhealth for more info
```

## Getting Started

We have working copies of Neovim and Swift on our path. While we can start with
a `vimrc` file, Neovim is transitioning from using vimscript to Lua. Lua
is easier to find documentation for since it's an actual programming language,
tends to run faster, and pulls your configuration out of the main runloop so
your editor stays nice and snappy.
You can still use a `vimrc` with vimscript, but we'll use Lua.

The main Neovim configuration file goes in `~/.config/nvim`. The other Lua files
go in `~/.config/nvim/lua`. Go ahead and create an `init.lua` now;

```console
 $  mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim/lua && cd ~/.config/nvim
 $  nvim init.lua
```

> Note: The examples below contain a GitHub link to the plugin to help you readily access the documentation. You can also explore the plugin itself.

## Packaging with _lazy.nvim_

While it's possible to set everything up manually, using a package manager helps
keep your packages up-to-date, and ensures that everything is installed
correctly when copy your configuration to a new computer. Neovim also has a
built-in plugin manager, but I have found
[_lazy.nvim_](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) to work well.

We will start with a little bootstrapping script to install _lazy.nvim_ if it
isn't installed already, add it to our runtime path, and finally configure our
packages.

At the top of your `init.lua` write:
```lua
local lazypath = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/lazy/lazy.nvim"
if not vim.loop.fs_stat(lazypath) then
    vim.fn.system({
        "git",
        "clone",
        "--filter=blob:none",
        "https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim.git",
        "--branch=stable",
        lazypath
    })
end
vim.opt.rtp:prepend(lazypath)
```

This snippet clones _lazy.nvim_ if it doesn't already exist, and then adds it to the
runtime path. Now we initialize _lazy.nvim_ and tell it where to look for the plugin
specs.

```lua
require("lazy").setup("plugins")
```

This configures _lazy.nvim_ to look in a `plugins/` directory under our `lua/`
directory for each plugin. We'll also want a place to put our own non-plugin
related configurations, so we'll stick it in `config/`. Go ahead and create
those directories now.

```console
 $  mkdir lua/plugins lua/config
```

See [lazy.nvim Configuration](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-configuration) for details on configuring _lazy.nvim_.

![_lazy.nvim_ package manger](/assets/images/zero-to-swift-nvim/Lazy.png)

Note that your configuration won't look exactly like this.
We have only installed _lazy.nvim_, so that is the only plugin that is listed on
your configuration at the moment.
That's not very exciting to look at, so I've added a few additional plugins to
make it look more appealing.

To check that it's working:
 - Launch Neovim.

   You should first see an error saying that there were no specs found for
   module plugins. This just means that there aren't any plugins.

 - Press Enter and type, `:Lazy`.

   _lazy.nvim_ lists the plugins installed. There should only be one right now:
   "lazy.nvim". This is _lazy.nvim_ tracking and updating itself.

 - We can manage our plugins through the _lazy.nvim_ menu.
    - Pressing `I` will install new plugins.
    - Pressing `U` will update installed plugins.
    - Pressing `X` will delete any plugins that _lazy.nvim_ installed, but are
      no longer tracked in your configuration.

## Language Server Support

Language servers respond to editor requests providing language-specific support.
Neovim has support for Language Server Protocol (LSP) built-in, so you don't
need an external package for LSP, but adding a configuration for each LSP server
manually is a lot of work. Neovim has a package for configuring LSP servers,
[nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig).

Go ahead and create a new file under `lua/plugins/lsp.lua`. In it, we'll start
by adding the following snippet.

```lua
return {
    {
        "neovim/nvim-lspconfig",
        config = function()
            local lspconfig = require('lspconfig')
            lspconfig.sourcekit.setup {}
        end,
    }
}
```

While this gives us LSP support through SourceKit-LSP, there are no keybindings,
so it's not very practical. Let's hook those up now.

We'll set up an auto command that fires when an LSP server attaches in the `config`
function under where we set up the `sourcekit` server. The keybindings are
applied to all LSP servers so you end up with a consistent experience across
languages.

```lua
config = function()
    local lspconfig = require('lspconfig')
    lspconfig.sourcekit.setup {}

    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('LspAttach', {
        desc = 'LSP Actions',
        callback = function(args)
            vim.keymap.set('n', 'K', vim.lsp.buf.hover, {noremap = true, silent = true})
            vim.keymap.set('n', 'gd', vim.lsp.buf.definition, {noremap = true, silent = true})
        end,
    })
end,
```

![LSP powered live error messages](/assets/images/zero-to-swift-nvim/LSP-Error.png)

I've created a little example Swift package that computes [Fibonacci
numbers](https://oeis.org/A000045) asynchronously.
Pressing `shift` + `k` on one of the references to the `fibonacci` function
shows the documentation for that function, along with the function signature.
The LSP integration is also showing that we have an error in the code.

### File Updating

SourceKit-LSP increasingly relies on the editor informing the server when
certain files change. This need is communicated through _dynamic registration_.
You don't have to understand what that means, but Neovim doesn't implement
dynamic registration. You'll notice this when you update your package manifest,
or add new files to your `compile_commands.json` file and LSP doesn't work without
restarting Neovim.

Instead, we know that SourceKit-LSP needs this functionality, so we'll enable it
statically. We'll update our `sourcekit` setup configuration to manually set the
`didChangeWatchedFiles` capability.

```lua
lspconfig.sourcekit.setup {
    capabilities = {
        workspace = {
            didChangeWatchedFiles = {
                dynamicRegistration = true,
            },
        },
    },
}
```

If you're interested in reading more about this issue, the conversations in the
following issues describe the issue in more detail:
 - [LSP: Implement dynamicRegistration](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/13634)
 - [add documentFormattingProvider to server capabilities response](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-eslint/pull/1307)

## Code Completion

![LSP-driven autocomplete completing the Foundation module](/assets/images/zero-to-swift-nvim/LSP-Autocomplete.png)

We will use [_nvim-cmp_](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) to act as the code completion mechanism.
We'll start by telling _lazy.nvim_ to download the package and to load it lazily when we enter insert
mode since you don't need code completion if you're not editing the file.

```lua
-- lua/plugins/codecompletion.lua
return {
    {
        "hrsh7th/nvim-cmp",
        version = false,
        event = "InsertEnter",
    },
}
```

Next, we'll configure some completion sources to provide code completion results.
_nvim-cmp_ doesn't come with completion sources, those are additional plugins.
For this configuration, I want results based on LSP, filepath completion, and
the text in my current buffer. For more, the _nvim-cmp_ Wiki has a [list of
sources](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp/wiki/List-of-sources).

To start, we will tell _lazy.nvim_ about the new plugins and that _nvim-cmp_ depends
on them.
This ensures that _lazy.nvim_ will initialize each of them when _nvim-cmp_ is loaded.

```lua
-- lua/plugins/codecompletion.lua
return {
    {
        "hrsh7th/nvim-cmp",
        version = false,
        event = "InsertEnter",
        dependencies = {
            "hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp",
            "hrsh7th/cmp-path",
            "hrsh7th/cmp-buffer",
        },
    },
    { "hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp", lazy = true },
    { "hrsh7th/cmp-path", lazy = true },
    { "hrsh7th/cmp-buffer", lazy = true },
}
```

Now we need to configure _nvim-cmp_ to take advantage of the code completion
sources.
Unlike many other plugins, _nvim-cmp_ hides many of its inner-workings, so
configuring it is a little different from other plugins. Specifically, you'll
notice the differences around setting key-bindings. We start out by requiring
the module from within its own configuration function and will call the setup
function explicitly.

```lua
{
    "hrsh7th/nvim-cmp",
    version = false,
    event = "InsertEnter",
    dependencies = {
        "hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp",
        "hrsh7th/cmp-path",
        "hrsh7th/cmp-buffer",
    },
    config = function()
        local cmp = require('cmp')
        local opts = {
            -- Where to get completion results from
            sources = cmp.config.sources {
                { name = "nvim_lsp" },
                { name = "buffer"},
                { name = "path" },
            },
            -- Make 'enter' key select the completion
            mapping = cmp.mapping.preset.insert({
                ["<CR>"] = cmp.mapping.confirm({ select = true })
            }),
        }
        cmp.setup(opts)
    end,
},
```

Using the `tab` key to select completions is a fairly popular option, so we'll
go ahead and set that up now.

```lua
mapping = cmp.mapping.preset.insert({
    ["<CR>"] = cmp.mapping.confirm({ select = true }),
    ["<tab>"] = cmp.mapping(function(original)
        if cmp.visible() then
            cmp.select_next_item() -- run completion selection if completing
        else
            original()      -- run the original behavior if not completing
        end
    end, {"i", "s"}),
    ["<S-tab>"] = cmp.mapping(function(original)
        if cmp.visual() then
            cmp.select_prev_item()
        else
            original()
        end
    end, {"i", "s"}),
}),
```

Pressing `tab` while the completion menu is visible will select the next
completion and `shift` + `tab` will select the previous item. The tab behavior
falls back on whatever pre-defined behavior was there originally if the menu
isn't visible.

## Snippets

Snippets are a great way to improve your workflow by expanding short pieces of
text into anything you like. Lets hook those up now. We'll use [_LuaSnip_](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip) as our
snippet plugin.

Create a new file in your plugins directory for configuring the snippet plugin.

```lua
-- lua/plugins/snippets.lua
return {
    {
        'L3MON4D3/LuaSnip',
        conifg = function(opts)
            require('luasnip').setup(opts)
            require('luasnip.loaders.from_snipmate').load({ paths = "./snippets" })
        end,
    },
}
```

Now we'll wire the snippet expansions into _nvim-cmp_. First, we'll add
_LuaSnip_ as a dependency of _nvim-cmp_ to ensure that it gets loaded before
_nvim-cmp_. Then we'll wire it into the tab key expansion behavior.

```lua
{
    "hrsh7th/nvim-cmp",
    version = false,
    event = "InsertEnter",
    dependencies = {
        "hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp",
        "hrsh7th/cmp-path",
        "hrsh7th/cmp-buffer",
        "L3MON4D3/LuaSnip",
    },
    config = function()
        local cmp = require('cmp')
        local luasnip = require('cmp')
        local opts = {
            -- Where to get completion results from
            sources = cmp.config.sources {
                { name = "nvim_lsp" },
                { name = "buffer"},
                { name = "path" },
            },
            mapping = cmp.mapping.preset.insert({
                -- Make 'enter' key select the completion
                ["<CR>"] = cmp.mapping.confirm({ select = true }),
                -- Super-tab behavior
                ["<tab>"] = cmp.mapping(function(original)
                    if cmp.visible() then
                        cmp.select_next_item() -- run completion selection if completing
                    elseif luasnip.expand_or_jumpable() then
                        luasnip.expand_or_jump() -- expand snippets
                    else
                        original()      -- run the original behavior if not completing
                    end
                end, {"i", "s"}),
                ["<S-tab>"] = cmp.mapping(function(original)
                    if cmp.visual() then
                        cmp.select_prev_item()
                    elseif luasnip.expand_or_jumpable() then
                        luasnip.jump(-1)
                    else
                        original()
                    end
                end, {"i", "s"}),
            }),
            snippets = {
                expand = function(args)
                    luasnip.lsp_expand(args)
                end,
            },
        }
        cmp.setup(opts)
    end,
},
```

Now our tab-key is thoroughly overloaded in super-tab fashion.
 - If the completion window is open, pressing tab selects the next item in the
   list.
 - If you press tab over a snippet, the snippet will expand, and continuing to
   press tab moves the cursor to the next selection point.
 - If you're neither code completing nor expanding a snippet, it will behave
   like a normal `tab` key.

Now we need to write up some snippets. _LuaSnip_ supports several snippet formats,
including a subset of the popular
[TextMate](https://macromates.com/textmate/manual/snippets),
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) snippet format,
and its own [Lua-based](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/Examples/snippets.lua) API.

Here are some snippets that I've found to be useful:

```snipmate
snippet pub "public access control"
  public $0

snippet priv "private access control"
  private $0

snippet if "if statement"
  if $1 {
    $2
  }$0

snippet ifl "if let"
  if let $1 = ${2:$1} {
    $3
  }$0

snippet ifcl "if case let"
  if case let $1 = ${2:$1} {
    $3
  }$0

snippet func "function declaration"
  func $1($2) $3{
    $0
  }

snippet funca "async function declaration"
  func $1($2) async $3{
    $0
  }

snippet guard
  guard $1 else {
    $2
  }$0

snippet guardl
  guard let $1 else {
    $2
  }$0

snippet main
  @main public struct ${1:App} {
    public static func main() {
      $2
    }
  }$0
```

Another popular snippet plugin worth mentioning is
[UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) which allows you to use inline
Python while defining the snippet, allowing you to write some very powerful
snippets.
