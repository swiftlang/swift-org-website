To create a new Swift project, you can use the `Swift: Create New Project...` command in
the Swift extension to guide you through the process. You can find this command by opening
the Command Palette and following the instructions below.

- For macOS: `⇧⌘P`
- Other platforms: `Ctrl + Shift + P`

1. In the command palette, search for the `Swift: Create New Project...` command.
2. Choose the type of project you'd like to create from the list of templates.

3. Choose the directory where the project will be stored.
4. Give your project a name.
5. Open the newly created project. You will be prompted to open the project in
   the current window, a new window, or add it to the current workspace. The
   default behaviour can be configured by using the
   `swift.openAfterCreateNewProject` setting.
